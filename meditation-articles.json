I remember asking myself isn't it possible to get an other view on my feelings and emotions, in terms of reacting in a calm and composed way from early on or how I was sitting in highschool during a break with my eyes closed, listening to my classmates making fun of me and the teacher responding that they should leave me in peace. Nevertheless.\n\nI quit school during my Abitur (I'm german btw) because I was smoking to much and the fact that I was thinking that I don't need that graduation to fulfil my will and purpose. I kept working in a local recordstore was paid with some weed and records and decided to start a apprenticeship in Berlin to become a recordseller. My girlfriend followed to Berlin and everything went quite alright. After some time I decided to ask for a open relationship. My girlfriend did not like that and broke up after a short time without even trying it.\n\nDuring that time I got more into meditation and was smoking way to much. After some time I got a different way of understanding and feeling of my self. My perception got more focused on my body and feeling what is going on inside me. I thought that I am able to ease tensions and meditate about past things that were moving my thoughts and behavior. I started to grow a big self conscious and self love. \n\nIt got weird when I was starting to move my body to relieve tensions and got to points where the opposite happened and I started to force cramps. During that period I started to feel like somehow an √úbermensch, I thought I could communicate by telepathy and help others by sharing the feeling of selflove I just recently discovered. Sometimes by talking to someone mostly by just being in a park and starting to move and dance without any music playing just moving in directions I felt was right. I did that until I completely lost myself and the feeling of love I found, being in a state of insecurity, hopelessness and huge discomfort. I thought people around me were laughing at me and telling me indirectly that I will be disabled. I went to my ex-girlfriends place and she just told me to sleep and go to work the next day. Did that, I had a mental breakdown crying and our personal manager drove me to the hospital.\nLong story short after running away I was at Potsdamer Platz seeing a group of police looking for someone. Turns out it was me. They saw that I don't do any harm to anyone and just kept myself safe until emergency arrived. In the hospital i told them about what was going on. Stayed there for 2 weeks without really taking anything serious. Got diagnosed with cannabinoid psychosis. Did not take my meds everything got worse, started smoking again. All symptoms got worse. I was still able to somehow finish m apprenticeship with the dear help and understanding of my colleagues. Went back to my grandparents place and shit got worse again. I started to work in a very strict storage which totally stressed me out to a point where I completely lost myself and wasn't even able to feel myself and be under control of myself and my body and my surroundings. Everything felt that it would happen because of me or at least effecting me in a very scary way.\n\nI decided to go to the hospital again, called my dad, he brought me there. Blackout - 2 weeks followed by another 2 months open psychiatry. It got way better. Less or no symptoms.\n\nWhat kept me alive during all of that was philosophy and meditation. I was able to behold some parts of myself by knowing that I was able to go threw all of this and quotes from Marcus Aurelius like Everything happens for a reason or Everything that happens to you is human and you are able to go threw it.\n\nNow I use meditation to calm myself and body, focusing on my breath or movement without judgement and the desire to control my emotions.\n\nHopefully the text isn't to long and some get something out of it. I am very open to questions, feel free.\n\nThank you for reading : )\n\ntl:dr\ngot into a psychosis after meditating and smoking to much weed","t2_crgiqmn","Is it OK if I meditate everyday?","And I watch tv everyday too. I am new to meditation.","t2_6hffl6xk","Feel a lot of resistance to meditation after a recent traumatic event","Hi all.\n\nI had a traumatic event happen to me recently and it caused me to go into a bit of a depression where I stopped doing any of my habits. I am trying to bounce back now and am doing so quite well, apart from meditating. Every time I meditate, I become extremely uncomfortable, and strong emotions arise. Just wondering if you guys have any tips for me to get back into it. Thanks in advance.","t2_8khlaegc","Non-self","I don‚Äôt know this is a Buddhist idea but I think it relates to meditation.\n\nI‚Äôve heard a lot of talk of ‚Äúnon-self,‚Äù i.e. there is no actual self.  Everything we think of as the self is just a concept, as far as I understand it.  I struggle with grasping this, and I‚Äôm sure many people new to meditation do.\n\nBut I recently had an insight.  Meditation is a means to get to our most basic nature, our awareness.  And I realized that this nature is literally the one thing that connects every human being together.  Every human being that has lived or will live experiences the same basic awareness, regardless of race, social status etc.\n\nMaybe there is no self because we are all the same.","t2_cgpg26","how good is meditation for reducing anxiety and social anxiety?","For those who are suffering from anxiety/social anxiety and/or intrusive thoughts, did meditation help you?","t2_2scsxgfc","Grinding in videogames as a form of meditation?","For those who are not gamers, grinding is doing repetitive tasks in a game, often slaying monsters for loot.\n\n[https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2020/11/07/can-gaming-act-as-meditation/](https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2020/11/07/can-gaming-act-as-meditation/)\n\nI've often found grinding to be relaxing, and have also brought other meditative practices into games, such as being in nature (I find beautiful places to relax in virtual worlds)\n\nJust thought I would bring up the subject for discussion.","t2_w37ox","Seeing purple threads in my meditations üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","Hi all, I have been practicing 20 minutes meditations every day for the last 5-6 months but lately I've started to visualise what I can only describe as purple silk threads flowing in the wind.

And post covid life was mentally traumatic too because I didn't have job. \nFor like past 3 months, I have been doing the meditation for 45 min twice a day, and have maintained a daily journal throughout with recap every week. \nBut I can't seem to have any change in my thought process or mental fight or attention or anything. \nCan someone explain this to me,please üòî","t2_7cdtlski","Very Bright light appearing during meditation","Hi all, wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or could explain. Recently during meditation, while my eyes were closed, a super bright light (blinding light actually) appeared in my eye, as if someone was shining a flashlight through my eyelid. It was so bright it actually made me instinctively open my eyes and lose my meditation focus. \n\nToday, I was listening to kirtan and singing along and same thing happened. \n\nAny explanations?

The results obtained are remarkable, however, the investigators emphasize that so far, these results have only been obtained in a single individual.\n\n2014 study\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034215/\n\n&gt;&gt;ABSTRACT:  Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention (n¬†= 12) or control group (n¬†= 12). Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation), \n\n&gt;&gt;Meditation, so-called ‚Äúthird eye meditation,‚Äù a form of meditation including visualizations aimed at total relaxation.\n\n[I do not know why they refer to it as \"third eye meditation\", since it was simply oscillations between breath focus and image focus, the Wim Hof meditation method that he recommends is just breath focus, below]\n\n&gt;&gt;breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng/kg¬†Escherichia coli¬†endotoxin). [...] In conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate immune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important implications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.\n\nWim Hof meditation is just Mindfulness of Breath incorporating deep breathing:\n\nhttps://www.wimhofmethod.com/breathing-meditation\n\n&gt;&gt;Meditation is great for relieving stress, for¬†boosting your concentration, and it can even¬†help you sleep better. Breathing properly is an important part of every form of meditation, as it helps to calm your body, which brings you to a state of relaxation. Focusing on your breath while meditating serves two purposes: it keeps your mind from wandering, and it gives you the opportunity to improve your breathing technique. The Wim Hof Method can help you get the most out of your breaths, and you can easily incorporate¬†the Wim Hof breathing exercises¬†into your meditation routine.\n\n**Focus**\n\nFocus - *Hocus Pocus*\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RFDW9b_ejfI\n\nI use meditation focus to get World Record High Scores at vintage video games:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/vintagegaming/comments/ts1m74/fire_991_points_game_watch_original_handheld/\n\n**Breathing**\n\nMeditation does not bring stress relief or improve memory, it is only a focus training exercise.\n\nFor these benefits, breathe with me:\n\n\"The Prodigy - Breathe\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rmHDhAohJlQ\n\nBreathe deep, and do it any time you think about your breath.\n\nYour breath is the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nIt is an invisible bodypart that is also part of my body.\n\nIt is also whale breath and microbe breath.\n\nIt is the breath of the plants and fungi.\n\nIt is an invisible part of our bodies that we all share.\n\nMy mind is not your mind.\n\nThe structure of my body is not the structure of your body.\n\nOur breath, however, is the Earth's atmosphere, an invisible bodypart, bigger than the surface of the planet.\n\nPeer reviewed article from *Nature*:\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/npp2013327\n\n&gt;&gt;Prolonged, elevated cortisol [The Primary Stress Hormone] levels in animals are also shown to cause atrophy [Weakening] in the hippocampus [The Brain's Memory Center]and hypertrophy [Growth] in the amygdala [The Brain's Fear Center], largely through changes in dendritic remodeling[Parts Of Brain Cells That Catch Messages From Other Brain Cells]. These structural changes may contribute to deficits in appropriate feedback onto the HPA axis.

Other studies have shown that we tend to be more attuned to fear when we're breathing quickly. Conversely, it may be possible to reduce fear and anxiety by slowing down our breath.\n\nhttps://www.canr.msu.edu/news/understanding_cortisol_the_stress_hormone\n\n&gt;&gt;Deep breathing causes the vagus nerve [Immune System And Heart Rate Control] to signal your nervous system to lower your heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol [The Primary Stress Hormone]. Taking just ten deep breaths can assist with relaxation and provide a sense of calm.\n\n**Happiness**\n\nAs of 2017, Matthieu Ricard had been part of a study involving Buddhist Monks attached to electroencephalographs asked to focus on feelings and moods.\n\nWhen asked to focus on happiness, Matthieu Ricard went off the charts.\n\nHe was the happiest human ever so recorded.\n\nOthers, through this technique, have most probably met or surpassed his level of happiness, by now.\n\nHis technique.\n\nI do not know of or recommend any of his other teachings, this seems like plenty.\n\nhttps://www.insider.com/how-to-meditate-buddhist-monk-matthieu-ricard-2018-1\n\n&gt;First, sit comfortably with your eyes closed or unfocused and breathe in and exhale slowly, focusing on your breath. As thoughts race through your mind, don't actively try to ignore them, but rather let them float by, without attaching to any particular one. If you find yourself distracted, bring your focus to your breathing.\n\n&gt;When you are sufficiently relaxed, think of someone who makes you happy. Focus on your altruistic love for them.\n\nDo not focus on the person, your mood about them could shift at any time.\n\nFocus on the sensation of happiness and hold that focus as long as you can.\n\nThis is mindfulness of happiness.\n\n**The Third Eye**\n\nTool - *Third Eye*\n\nAnd, at last, the treasure what you came here for to find: the hard sought and mystical secret of that \"Third Eye\" thingy:\n\nYou will laugh in a moment.\n\nIf you have developed even a modicum of meditative focus, you ought to be able to do this as you read the instruction.\n\nRelax your face.\n\nEyes barely open, but open \n\nLet your forehead, cheeks, eyelids, lips, just hang.\n\nBreathe through your nose, in and out.\n\nYou should gradually feel a tingle in your forehead.\n\nFocus your mind, not your eyes but your mind, on that tingle.\n\nEyes are not closed.\n\nHold it for a minute or two\n\nYou should start to feel a fluttery sensation in your face.\n\nThe sensation may wash over your body but you should hold your focus, not your eyes, your focus on your forehead.\n\nIt just tingles and flutters.\n\nIt may feel overwnelming, but hold it.\n\nThis is your breath and pulse tickling the nerves inside of your face.\n\nDon't laugh, yet.\n\nHold that focus.\n\nWhat you have previously been doing seems to be inadvertantly crossing your eyes while they are closed, that's the pressure and even pain you have been feeling.\n\nChakras are nerve centers, not magic universal binders.\n\nThere is no 3rd eye.\n\nNow, adjust your neck and you should feel a dopamine flush flutter down your spine.\n\nThat is all it is.\n\nFeels nice.","t2_4nt8w","Your eyes are adjusting to the light","If you feel at all heavy     \nAnd it feels like the night     \nThe light is still there     \nIn fact it's too bright      \n\nBecause what if it's true     \nThat this darkness you keep finding     \nIs actually just light     \nSo bright that it's blinding","t2_jkb4tlcr","Evolution of my meditation journey. Where to now?","I‚Äôm still fairly new. I resisted for a really long time but I‚Äôm so glad I got into it. \n\nI started by just focusing on my breath &amp; being mindful of it &amp; my thoughts. It was super hard because I was so judgemental and fidgety. \n\nThen I started doing guided meditations that target different things; anxiety, surrender, compassion, etc\n\nLately I‚Äôm doing what I was doing before (focusing on breath and watching my thoughts) and I‚Äôm enjoying it more than I did the first time. I get bored of guided meditations.\n\nBut now I feel kind of stuck, how do I progress from here? What should I get good at or learn or achieve or seek or aim for?

My arms begin to feel like rising above my head and usually they \"go back\" after a couple of minutes. But today this rising of my hands started really fast and all of a sudden I was in a very deep state of meditation where I never really was before. On top of that rising sensation, my gut begin to feel very nervous and euphoric which expanded to the rest of my body. The feeling you get when you ride a rollercoaster but more like all the time and much more intense.\n\nI tried to stay focused on my mantra since I read that even these strong sensations should not distract you from your mantra. But these feelings became too intense and ended in a flickering vision in front of my inner eye. My heart was racing and I needed to get myself out this meditation session. \n\nI was literally scared by \"what might comes next\". Can anyone relate to this? Do I need to be afraid...I mean can anything happen to me? I am afraid to experience something which alters the view of my life in a negative way if that makes sense to you.\n\nLooking forward to read your experiences!","t2_apdmozct","When I try to meditate, so much anxiety &amp; past trauma comes up for me","I try to hard to observe it/label it and go back to my breath.

Flashback and constant thoughts keep popping after closing my eyes.

Because of anxiety it's getting difficult to do normal day to day things also. I get scared and distracted at even small noise. While sleeping also I don't get into deep sleep.

I saw symbols last night while meditating for the first time and wrote them down, but man I have no idea what these are or what they mean?? One of them was an elongated upside down 4 (that's the best way I can explain it) and that one was kind of separate from the others -- the other two were paired, one on top one on bottom. the bottom symbol was just a square but describing the top one will be hard through text -- It was œΩ with a zig zag hanging off the top end of the c thing, and at the end of the zig zag was a tiny square??\n\nI feel like i am confusing myself HAHAHA but I just thought this was interesting! if you have any ideas go for it!","t2_xo0b6","I think it works","Been meditating for about five years.
